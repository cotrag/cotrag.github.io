Using new data from the US Census Bureau, I mapped housing insecurity by state. The interactive map can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/leeter/mortgage_def_may_june). It is safe to say that may and June represent a crisis that all governments would do well to address. This crisis is still ongoing. [Attached](https://rpubs.com/leeter/pulse_wk_17) is a map of people who rent housing responding yes to the question "Is this household currently caught up on rent payments?" on a survey conduced between October 14 and October 26 by the US Census Bureau. In total, 11.7% of renting households in the United States are late on rent.
